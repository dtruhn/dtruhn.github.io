            <h2>Multimodal AI</h2>
            <p>
              We develop multimodal fusion algorithms that combine information
              from multiple imaging modalities, patient histories, and
              multi-omics data. By integrating these diverse data sources, we
              aim to enable more precise diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic
              decisions.

            <p>
              We investigate the potential of generative models, such as
              diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), in
              the medical domain. We leverage these techniques to synthesize
              realistic medical images for data sharing or augmentation of
              training data. By pushing the boundaries of generative modeling,
              we seek to enhance the capabilities of AI systems in healthcare.

            <h2>Large Language Models</h2>
            <p>
              We explore the capabilities of large language models in processing
              and analyzing medical data. By fine-tuning these models on
              domain-specific medical texts and electronic health records, we
              aim to extract valuable insights, generate clinical summaries, and
              support decision-making processes. Our research investigates the
              potential of language models in tasks such as medical question
              answering, clinical note summarization, and patient risk
              stratification.

            <p>
              One of our primary areas of expertise is precision oncology of
              solid tumors, including immunotherapy. We develop deep learning
              methods for automated tumor segmentation, characterization, and
              treatment response assessment from medical images. Our research
              aims to reduce inter-observer variability in cancer diagnosis and
              provide objective tools to assist pathologists and radiologists.
              We also work on identifying clinically relevant morphologic
              phenotypes and biomarkers associated with response to specific
              therapeutic agents.

              Our lab also focuses on applying AI techniques to musculoskeletal
              imaging. We develop methods for automated segmentation and
              analysis of musculoskeletal structures, such as bones, cartilage,
              and tendons, from MRI data. Our research aims to improve the
              accuracy and efficiency of musculoskeletal disease diagnosis,
              monitor disease progression, and assess treatment outcomes. We
              collaborate closely with clinical experts to develop AI-aided
              diagnostic tools that can be integrated into clinical workflows.
