              ODELIA - Open Source Swarm Learning to Empower Medical AI
            </h2>
            <p>
              ODELIA is a unique and groundbreaking project that harnesses the
              power of swarm learning to revolutionize medical AI in a
              privacy-preserving and democratic way. With the first open source
              pan-European swarm learning network, we aim to develop and
              validate AI algorithms for breast cancer detection in MRI
              screening examinations, and paving the way for numerous other
              clinical applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              To ensure the project's success and deliver its transformative
              results, ODELIA is structured into eight distinct work packages,
              each focusing on specific tasks and objectives. These work
              packages cover everything from creating a minimum viable product
              to addressing regulatory frameworks and fostering communication
              among stakeholders. By breaking down the project into manageable
              components, ODELIA is poised to make a lasting impact on the
              medical AI landscape and improve healthcare outcomes for patients
              across Europe.

            Transform Liver - Scaling up Vision Transformers for Biomarkers in

          </h2>
          <p>
            Liver diseases are widespread in Germany and Europe and are an
            increasingly important cause of sickness and mortality.
            Computer-aided assistance systems can use artificial intelligence
            (AI) to contribute to early detection and therapy decisions in liver
            diseases, for example by processing image and tabular data.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this project, the partners are developing Vision Transformer
            (ViT, a deep learning architecture), the latest and most powerful
            type of artificial neural network, specifically for the diagnosis
            and risk prediction of liver disease. They are building on results
            from non-medical fields that have not yet been applied to medical
            research. For the first time, the researchers are enabling the
            systematic use of the new transformer technology for medical issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            The consortium has a large collection of image data and associated
            patient data such as age, gender and comorbidities. This data will
            be used to train new AI models (transformers). The goal is to
            generate new biomarkers to predict disease progression and provide
            information for personalised patient treatment. These biomarkers are
            expected to outperform classical approaches based on conventional
            neural networks. In addition, TRANSFORM LIVER will provide a better
            understanding of disease processes in the liver, in particular
            cellular interactions, by applying explanatory approaches to trained
            transformers.

            Modern cancer research is generating more extensive data sets (big
            data) than ever. The data originates from molecular and biochemical
            analyses, modern imaging procedures, clinical studies or depicts the
            course of a patient's disease. These treasures of data sets need to
            be exploited in the future. New computer-aided approaches to use
            such data, namely artificial intelligence, machine learning and
            statistics are of great importance for the improved analysis and
            extraction of research-relevant information. With this funding
            guideline as part of the “Nationale Dekade gegen Krebs” the Federal
            Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) intends to provide
            research groups from the field of data analysis with low-threshold
            access to high-quality data from translational, biomedical cancer
            research and routine oncological care. At the same time, researchers
            from the fields of data acquisition and data analysis work closely
            together to address clinically relevant oncological questions. In
            addition, the culture of data sharing for research purposes is to be
            promoted.
