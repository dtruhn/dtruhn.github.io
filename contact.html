            We are always seeking talented and motivated individuals to join our
            dynamic and interdisciplinary team. If you are a passionate student
            or researcher interested in the exciting field of AI applications in
            medicine, we would love to hear from you!
          </p>
          <p>We offer various opportunities for collaboration, including:</p>
          <ul class="opportunity-list">
            <li>
              Master Thesis: If you are a high-achieving master's student with a
              strong academic background in computer science, physics,
              electrical engineering, or a related field, and have a keen
              interest in medical AI, we encourage you to consider pursuing your
              master thesis with us. This is also an excellent opportunity for
              us to get to know you and potentially follow-up with a carrier as

            <p>
              Fill all edges of this graph with the number 1 to 24. Each number
              can only be used one. The numbers 7, 12, 20, and 24 are already
              given. The nodes provide additional constraints:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="assets/empty-white-circle.svg" /> The number inside this
              node denotes the sum of all edges directly connected to it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="assets/empty-blue-circle.svg" /> There exists a
              non-intersecting path starting from this node with the sum of the
              weights of the edges along that path equaling the number within
              this node. Multiple numbers refer to multiple paths (may overlap).
            </p>

              <img src="assets/science-circle.svg" />
              <img src="assets/ai-circle.svg" />
              Once you filled all edges find the shortest weighted path from the
              scientist to the AI-chip and convert it to letters (1=A, 2=B etc.)
              to reveal the secret message.
