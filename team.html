        Dr. Tianyu Han is a postdoc researcher at the University Hospital RWTH
        Aachen's Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology. With a
        PhD in Physics from RWTH Aachen University, his doctoral study explored
        generative modeling for medical image analysis, resulting in multiple
        high-impact publications in Nature Machine Intelligence, Nature
        Communications, Radiology, and Science Advances. Since completing his
        PhD, Dr. Han has extended his research to developing and deploying
        advanced large language models (LLMs) for medical applications. His
        notable contributions include the creation of MedAlpaca, an open-source
        medical LLM, and the compilation of Medical Meadow, a substantial
        medical dataset designed for LLM training. His research has demonstrated
        the practical utility of multimodal LLMs in clinical settings,
        contributing to their adoption for general medical image interpretation.
        Dr. Han’s work has also led to significant advancements in using
        adversarially trained models for pathology detection and the anonymous
        sharing of medical data through generative models. His innovative
        methodologies have not only enhanced diagnostic accuracies but also
        facilitated the understanding of radiological confounders on an
        individual level.
