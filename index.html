      <h2 id="about-us">About us</h2>
      <p>
        We are an interdisciplinary group of clinicians and researchers, working
        on advanced imaging methods to improve diagnostics and treatment
        guidance in a variety of fields. Our main goal is to refine imaging to
        improve patient care by bringing together profound clinical expertise, a
        deep understanding of imaging, a hands-on approach to engineering, and
        refined computer skills. Our main tools are our MRI scanners and the
        respective hardware and software equipment, human and artificial
        intelligence, as well as mechanical and computational models.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advanced medical imaging has revolutionized patient care over the last
        decades facilitating earlier identification and refined graduation of
        diseases, faster therapeutic decision-making, and better monitoring of
        treatment outcomes. As one of the top developments in the field of
        medicine, advanced medical imaging offers great benefits to patients and
        doctors. Every patient we encounter in our clinical practice teaches us
        that there is still room for medical and technical improvement, even
        though medicine and medical technology have come a long way
      </p>
      <h2>Affiliation</h2>
      <p>
        We are principally based at the Department of Diagnostic and
        Interventional Radiology of the University Hospital at RWTH Aachen
        (Germany) in close proximity to neighbouring Belgium and the
        Netherlands. In addition, we are closely affiliated with the Department
        of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology of the University Hospital
        DÃ¼sseldorf (Germany) and the Institute of Computer Vision (RWTH Aachen
        University). Moreover, we have numerous collaborations with local,
        national, and international partner institutions.
